I made this game with the idea inspired by the game Brotato, but instead of a potato, it features a small mushroom fighting alien monsters :)) . Players will strive to survive through each wave of monsters and choose reasonable upgrades to build their character in order to maximize their power as much as possible. I am also using the soundtrack from Brotato; this is just a personal learning project, not for commercialization or make profit. I have coded this game over the course of 3 weeks, so it still has quite a few features, but I will refine it and add many exciting updates in the future!!!
